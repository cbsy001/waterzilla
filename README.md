# POS Webapp

## _The product of CS502070_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/trngbro/)

Develop a website that provides Point of Sale functionality for the purpose of selling at a retail store of phones and accessories. The users of this web app are salespeople and administrator at a phone store. Phone buyers are not users of this web app. Basically, this web app needs to provide functions such as: sales transactions, product management, employee management, viewing reports and statistics. This type of application is commonly found in retail stores in Vietnam such as electronics, clothing, food and beverage stores or supermarkets.
